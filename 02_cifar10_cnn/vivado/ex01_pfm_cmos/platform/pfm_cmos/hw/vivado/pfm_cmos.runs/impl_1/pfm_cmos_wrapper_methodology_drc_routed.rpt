TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock pfm_cmos_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin pfm_cmos_i/clk_wiz_1/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree
