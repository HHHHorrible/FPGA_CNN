2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#1 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HDMI_CLK_N relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#2 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HDMI_CLK_P relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#3 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HDMI_D0_N relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#4 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HDMI_D0_P relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#5 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HDMI_D1_N relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#6 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HDMI_D1_P relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#7 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HDMI_D2_N relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-18#8 Warning
Missing input or output delay  
An output delay is missing on HDMI_D2_P relative to clock(s) VIRTUAL_clk_out2_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 
Related violations: <none>
